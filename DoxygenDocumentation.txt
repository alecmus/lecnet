To generate Doxygen documentation that includes only files in the public interface:

1. Create a folder
2. Copy the contents of /include/liblec/lecnet to the folder (tcp.h, ... etc.)
3. Copy the following files to the folder as well:
	Doxyfile
	lecnet.h
4. Go to the commandline and run "doxygen Doxyfile" (C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin needs to have already been added to the user account's PATH environment variable).
5. Copy the folders "html" and "latex" from the folder and replace the older ones in the docs folder in the repo (delete the older one first, don't overwrite ... replace).

This process mimicks the file structure in the repo, but excludes those files that are not in the public interface.
